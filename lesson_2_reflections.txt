How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a holding area for the files intended for a
commit. This allows the user to break down commits into logical changes
rather than be forced to commit the contents of the working directory 
entirely which would not allow such flexibility.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

You could use the staging area and the "git diff" function to see what
changes you have applied to the file. This will allow the user to
clearly see the changes they have made so far. If the developer starts
with a goal in mind then they can easily commit each goal or breakdown
their tasks into simpler more meaningful tasks.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches will allow the user to experiment with the program maybe
try some experimental features, create an alternate version of the
program, while leaving the core program unaffected by the cheanges.
If it is decided that the experiment is a success and the features
are to be incorporated then the changes in the branch may be merged
with the master even if the master has gone through some changes
since the branch was created

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams will allow the user to easily naviagte and track any changes
or experiments made to the program. It is much more intuitive and easier
to follow than a whole block of text

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches allows the user to integrate two pieces of code to a working state using merging logic.
Merging Logic:

Jake: B D E
Rachel: A B C D
Original: A B D

Final: B C D E

Any deletions (Like Jake deleted A) will be removed from the Final any 
additions will be inserted (Like E from Jake and C from Rachel) in the 
Final

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Gits auto merge feature is great! It allows the users to merge 
seemingly different code into a single functioning piece with the logic 
previously discussed. If it so happens that a piece of code is simply 
altered or a common ancestor between the code is altered then it is 
left to the user to decide which one to implement since the user is the 
expert on the content of the code. This ensures transparency and 
approval from the user. The manual merge conflict resolution highlights 
the changes between the current HEAD and the branch to merge with in 
the file with the conflict with "<<<<<<<<<<<HEAD" for the difference 
between the common ancestor and the current HEAD. "||||||||||| merged 
common ancestors" for the code before the it was branched and edited.
Finally ">>>>>>>>>>{name-of-branch}" for the difference between the 
common ancestor and the {name-of-branch}. All in all its quiet badass. I can see very applicable uses for my secret master plan to save the planet and its poor people, muahahahahaha, its verking :)
